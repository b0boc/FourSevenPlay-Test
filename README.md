I implemented data type and value checks for the fetched data. In case the API is returning a non hex value the event is displayed in the console.

Angular version: ^9.1.12  

For gulp I used the following packages:
gulp: "^4.0.2",
gulp-rename: "^2.0.0",
gulp-sass: "^4.1.0"

$ npm install package_name --save-dev

$ gulp scss
The scss function will watch, convert, and minify the scss

The gulpfile.js is also attached

I really enjoyed this challenge.

I am looking forward to your feedback!
